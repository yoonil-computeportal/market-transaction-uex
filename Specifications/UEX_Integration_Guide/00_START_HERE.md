- ✅ Complete KYC before testing production

### Don'ts ❌
- ❌ Skip the KYC verification step
- ❌ Test with large amounts initially
- ❌ Hardcode credentials in source code
- ❌ Ignore error messages from UEX
- ❌ Deploy without testing webhooks/polling
- ❌ Forget to implement monitoring
- ❌ Use the same wallet for test and production
- ❌ Skip the security checklist
